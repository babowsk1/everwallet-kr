## Receiving

In order to find your address or QR code for receiving tokens click on the <mark style="color:orange;">**Receive**</mark> <mark style="color:orange;"></mark><mark style="color:orange;"></mark> button. \
This is your account address where your tokens will be stored. \
You will have to share this address with whoever will send you tokens, regardless of the token being sent (this applies, of course, only to EVER token and other TIP-3.1 tokens).

**(1) Select the token** you want to send (if the token is not displayed, add it in the [select assets menu](./)).\
**(2)** Enter the **number of tokens** you want to send .\
**(3)** Enter the [**receiver’s address**](sending-and-receiving-tokens.md#receiving)**.**\
**(4)** **Commentary** (sometimes a receiver will require you to put something in this field).

Fill out the required fields and click **Send**. \
Once more, check the receiver’s address and familiarize yourself with the commission on the transfer. \
If everything checks out, enter your seed **password** and click **Confirm transaction**.
