# Creating a Multisig account

The process of creating a Multisig wallet is somewhat different. \
Let's start from the very beginning:

1\. Proceed to [**create** ](../getting-started/install-and-singing-in/creating-a-new-wallet.md)or [**add a new account**](../seed-phrase-keys-and-accounts/account-management/). Choose a name for the new account and click **Next**.

2\. Choose the appropriate [type of wallet](../getting-started/install-and-singing-in/types-of-wallet.md) and click **Create account**.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you want to use a multisig wallet with 3 or more custodians on FlatQube and Octus Bridge, be sure to use **BridgeMultisigWallet** type!
{% endhint %}

3\. When the wallet is created, proceed to [**deploy**](../getting-started/install-and-singing-in/deploy/).&#x20;

4\. When deploying, select **Multi-signature** wallet and click **Next**.&#x20;

5\. Select the number of custodians that will require confirmation for the transaction and enter the **public key** for each custodian.&#x20;

6\. Click **Deploy**.

Now your multisig wallet is ready to go. \
Now the custodian needs to [**add it to his EVER Wallet** ](add-a-multisig-account.md)to confirm transactions.
