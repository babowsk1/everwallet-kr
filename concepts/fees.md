# Fees

Whenever your address interacts with Everscale network contracts, you need to pay a fee. \
This type of commission is called **Blockchain fees**. Any other blockchain works in a similar way. Fees are one of the ways in which validators are rewarded for their work: fees from all transactions that have been included in newly created blocks are distributed among all participating validators. Everscale network fees are negligible and are limited to a few cents when making swaps.
