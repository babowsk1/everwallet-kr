# EVER & WEVER

**EVER** is Everscale's blockchain native token. This token is used when interacting with any contract on the network. It is with EVER that you pay the commission for any transaction.

The **Wrapped EVER** project allows Everscale's EVER token to be used as a TIP-3.1 compliant token.

Wrapped EVER works pretty much the same as Wrapped Ether.\
Minting and burning takes place on the Everscale network. Anyone can mint wEVER by locking EVER in the Vault contract. Also, wEVER can be burned to get EVER.

Use the [Wrappedever.io](https://wrappedever.io) interface to convert EVER to wEVER and vice versa.
