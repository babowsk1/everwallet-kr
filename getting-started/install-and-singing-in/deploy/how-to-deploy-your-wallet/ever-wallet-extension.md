# EVER Wallet Extension

After creating a new wallet, you need to deploy it in order to broadcast your transactions or make swaps.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
In order to deploy your wallet you will need some EVER. Find out how to get them from the page below.
{% endhint %}

{% endcontent-ref %}

1. Once you have EVERs in your wallet, you can click on the **Deploy** button.
2. Select the type of wallet you wish to deploy: Standart (if you are the only user of the wallet) or [Multisig](../../../../multisig/) (if the transaction has to be approved via different signatures)**.**

3\. Confirm the transaction and wait for it to complete.

4\. After the transaction is completed, you will see that you can now send tokens, which means that the wallet has been successfully deployed.
