# Creating a new wallet

1. Start by selecting the option **Create a new wallet.**
2. Select the [**type of wallet**](types-of-wallet.md) you wish to create.
3. Copy down your seed phrase and store it in a safe place. It is best to have a few physical copies of the seed phrase stored in different places.&#x20;
4. Pass through the seed phrase verification process.&#x20;
5. Create a password. You’re going to need your password in order to confirm all the transactions you make with the wallet.
